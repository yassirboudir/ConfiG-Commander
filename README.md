Switch Configuration Automation Web Application 

This project is a web application developed during my internship at Lear. The application automates the configuration of network switches, offering two main functionalities:

Configuring each switch individually.
Configuring all connected switches simultaneously.
Features : 

Individual Switch Configuration: Configure each switch separately.
Bulk Switch Configuration: Configure all connected switches at once.

User Synchronization: Synchronize with Active Directory (AD) users.

Technologies Used
Python
PySerial Library: Establishes a COM connection to communicate with the switches.

Getting Started
To run the application, use the following command:

python app.py

Have Fun!
Enjoy using the application!
