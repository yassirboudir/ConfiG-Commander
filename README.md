Just some stuff ive worked on in my period during an internship with lear the project is simple its a web-application that can automate switch configuration it has two options the option to configure each switch alone or all of the switches connected
its uses a library named pyserial that connected through the switch using COM connection 
also you synchronize it with ur AD users 
to run the app simply type : 
**python app.py**
uh have fun with the app ig
